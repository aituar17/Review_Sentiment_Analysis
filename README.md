# 📱 Review_Sentiment_Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Google Play Store reviews of the LinkedIn app across five countries (US, UK, Italy, Finland, Kazakhstan).
I collected thousands of reviews, applied sentiment analysis using VADER, and explored country-specific themes by examining the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.

The goal is to understand user sentiment patterns, identify pain points, and highlight regional differences in LinkedIn’s mobile app experience.
