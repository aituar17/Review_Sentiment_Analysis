# ðŸ“± Review_Sentiment_Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes Google Play Store reviews of the LinkedIn app across five countries (US, UK, Italy, Finland, Kazakhstan).
I collected thousands of reviews, applied sentiment analysis using VADER, and explored country-specific themes by examining the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.

The goal is to understand user sentiment patterns, identify pain points, and highlight regional differences in LinkedInâ€™s mobile app experience.
