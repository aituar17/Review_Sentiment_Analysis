# üì± Review_Sentiment_Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes Google Play Store reviews of the LinkedIn app across five countries (US, UK, Italy, Finland, Kazakhstan).
I collected thousands of reviews, applied sentiment analysis using VADER, and explored country-specific themes by examining the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.

The goal is to understand user sentiment patterns, identify pain points, and highlight regional differences in LinkedIn‚Äôs mobile app experience.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linkedin.android&pli=1)
- **App:** LinkedIn (Android)
- **Countries:** US, UK, Italy, Finland, Kazakhstan
- **Fields collected:** `reviewId`, `userName`, `rating`, `date`, `review`, `developer reply`, `country`
- **Tools:** `google-play-scraper` Python package
‚ö†Ô∏è Raw data is excluded from GitHub for size/privacy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. **Data Collection** (`01_collect_reviews.ipynb`)
    - Scraped reviews via Google Play API for 5 countries
    - Deduplicated and cleaned text
2. **Sentiment Analysis** (`02_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`)
    - Pre-processed reviews (removed links, special chars, etc.)
    - Applied **NLTK VADER** sentiment analyzer
    - Classified reviews into `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`
3. **Top Words Analysis** (`03_top_words_by_country.ipynb`)
    - Tokenized and lemmatized text
    - Removed stopwords and app-specific boilerplate terms (`linkedin`, `app`, `login`)
    - Identified top words by **(country, sentiment)**
  
## üìà Results & Insights
### Overall Sentiment Distribution
- The majority of reviews are **positive**, but a notable portion are **negative**, often mentioning login, crashes, and notifications.

### Sentiment by Country
- **US & UK:** Similar distribution, majority positive
- **Italy:** Higher share of negative reviews, often about access/login
- **Finland:** Fewer reviews, but more neutral/positive
- **Kazakhstan:** Small sample, skewed toward negative (login/verification issues)

### Country-specific Themes
#### Examples (based on top words analysis):
- **US (negative):** *login*, *crash*, *notification*
- **UK (positive):** *network*, *job*, *easy*
- **Italy (negative):** *accesso*, *bug*, *annuncio*
- **Finland (positive):** *jobs*, *useful*, *simple*
- **Kazakhstan (negative):** *login*, *verification*

## üí° Business Implications
- **Login/verification issues** remain a global frustration.
- **Positive reviews** highlight LinkedIn‚Äôs networking and job search features.
- **Regional differences** suggest targeted improvements (e.g., stability in Italy, smoother sign-ins in Kazakhstan).

## ‚öñÔ∏è Limitations & Next Steps
- Reviews are **self-selected** ‚Üí may not represent all users.
- Language bias: scraping was in English, so some Italian/Kazakh reviews may be underrepresented.
- Future extensions:
    - Multi-language sentiment models
    - Topic modeling (LDA/BERT) for deeper insights
    - Time-series analysis of sentiment trends
 
## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aituar17/Review_Sentiment_Analysis.git
cd Review_Sentiment_Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

‚ö†Ô∏è To reproduce: you must scrape reviews yourself (01_collect_reviews.ipynb) because raw data is not stored in the repo.
